      USDT deposits are calculated like USD according to effective pricing. For example, if you want to pay for 12 months, just transfer `49.99` USDT. You may transfer any amount you want, the subscription end date will be calculated accordingly in a proportion.

      We wait for *20 confirmations* for transaction to be processed, so you have to wait for a while. Once the transaction is processed, you will receive a notification with confirmation of your deposit. If your deposit is not credited, feel free to write us in @KebabSupport.
